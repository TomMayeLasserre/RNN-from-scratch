# RNN from Scratch

## Description

This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** from scratch using Python and NumPy. The project includes the core RNN implementation, a Jupyter Notebook explaining the mathematical foundations of RNNs, and another notebook for training and testing the model.

## Project Structure

- `RNN.py`: Contains the core implementation of the Recurrent Neural Network model.
- `RNN_maths_explenation.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that explains the mathematical operations behind RNNs, including the forward pass, recurrence, and backpropagation through time.
- `RNN_train_test.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for training and testing the RNN model on a dataset.

## Features

- **Custom RNN implementation**: The model is written from scratch using NumPy without relying on frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Mathematical explanation**: The project includes a detailed explanation of RNN operations such as the forward pass, recurrence, and backpropagation through time (BPTT).
- **Training and Testing**: The project provides a notebook for training the RNN model on a dataset and evaluating its performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
