# CNN from Scratch

## Description

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch using Python and NumPy. The project includes the core CNN implementation, a Jupyter Notebook explaining the mathematical foundations of CNNs, and another notebook for training and testing the model.

## Project Structure

- `CNN.py`: Contains the core implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network model.
- `CNN_maths_explenation.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that explains the mathematical operations behind CNNs, including convolution, pooling, and backpropagation.
- `CNN_train_test.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for training and testing the CNN model on a dataset.

## Features

- **Custom CNN implementation**: The model is written from scratch using NumPy without any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Mathematical explanation**: The project includes a detailed explanation of CNN operations such as convolution, pooling, and activation functions.
- **Training and Testing**: The project provides a notebook for training the CNN model on a dataset and evaluating its performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
